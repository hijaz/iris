This project is a feedforward neural network built entirely from scratch in vanilla JavaScript as a learning exercise. It is designed to solve the classic Iris flower classification problem, featuring a dynamic 3D visualization created with Three.js. This visualizer renders the network's structure and animates the training process in real-time, showing how weights, biases, and neuron activations change as the model learns from the data.
